# AWS-Key-Hunter

AWS Key Hunter is a production-ready tool that continuously scans GitHub repositories for exposed AWS access keys, validates them in real-time, and provides comprehensive reporting with permission analysis.

## Features üöÄ

- **Intelligent Scanning**: Contextual AWS key extraction with confidence scoring to reduce false positives
- **Rate Limiting**: Built-in GitHub API rate limiting with exponential backoff and smart retry logic
- **Real-time Validation**: Validates discovered keys using AWS STS and checks IAM/S3 permissions
- **Key Storage**: Saves valid keys with full metadata (account ID, username, ARN, permissions)
- **Deduplication**: Repository tracking prevents redundant processing and API waste
- **Robust Architecture**: Goroutine supervisor with health checks and automatic restart capability
- **Multiple Formats**: Export findings to JSON and CSV formats
- **Advanced Deduplication**: Account-level grouping, repository relationship detection, and content similarity analysis
- **Progress Monitoring**: Real-time progress indicators and comprehensive logging
- **Graceful Shutdown**: Clean context-based shutdown handling
- **Discord Integration**: Optional Discord alerts for valid findings
